# Deploying-Docker-Container-in-Remote-VM-using-Ansible
Our requirement is to write an ansible playbook to deploy Docker container in a remote VM using Ansible.

For this,we need to configure docker and then start the services of docker.Then,by using Docker Hub,we will pull image and then run the container.

I am using RHEL8 as my Ansible Controller Node.
